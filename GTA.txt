Grand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, is set in a revised depiction of southern San Andreas that only features Los Santos (Los Angeles) to the south and the rural Blaine County to the north. 
It includes revised landmarks such as the "Vinewood" sign (instead of Hollywood), Rockford Hills (instead of Beverly Hills), Del Perro Pier (instead of Santa Monica Pier), Los Santos International Airport (LSIA) (instead of LAX), Los Santos Golf Club (instead of Los Angeles Country Club), and Galileo Observatory (instead of Griffith Observatory). 
The game also features the town of Ludendorff in the fictional state of North Yankton. Los Angeles was extensively researched for Grand Theft Auto V. 
The team organised field research trips with tour guides and architectural historians and captured around 250,000 photos and hours of video footage during these visits. 
Since the release of the game, hundreds of in-game buildings have been identified as being based on real-world landmarks. 
The New Yorker's Sam Sweet notes that, with sales of the game reaching thirteen million copies, "there will be more people living in the imaginary state of Los Santos than in the real city on which it was modelled."
