Australia vs. England, 2003 World Cup Rugby Final.

First half
The first points of the final were scored by Australia. In the sixth minute, Lote Tuqiri outjumped the much shorter Jason Robinson and scored a try, following a sensational cross field kick from Wallaby fly-half Stephen Larkham. The conversion unsuccessfully crashed against a post. Jonny Wilkinson kicked a penalty goal for England in the 11th minute, bringing the score to 5-3. A further penalty goal by Wilkinson in the 20th minute took England into the lead, 6-5. In the 28th minute, following a Wallabies infringement Wilkinson slotted a penalty to make it 9-5. Following a flowing attacking move involving English forwards and backs, Robinson slid into the corner for a try for England in the 38th minute. England led at half-time 14-5.

Second half
Flatley kicked a penalty goal for Australia in the 47th minute, after the England scrummage was penalized by referee Andre Watson, taking the score to 14-8. With England dominant in possession but lacking in finishing Wilkinson made 2 unsuccessful drop goal attempts. England's forwards were again penalized by Watson in the 61st minute, and Flatley kicked the penalty goal for Australia. England were again to suffer when Flatley kicked a penalty goal on the 80th minute, taking the score to 14-14, and the match headed into extra time.

Extra time
Wilkinson and Flatley both scored penalties to put the score at 17-17. After having the ball returned to England from a Mat Rogers kick, and with 26 seconds on the clock, Wilkinson kicked a drop goal right-footed and England held on to win their first and only (so far) Rugby World Cup 20-17.
